Title: P-Spline Regression for Utility Functions and Derived Measures
Description: Predicts a smooth and continuous (individual) utility function from utility points, and computes measures of intensity for risk and higher-order risk measures (or any other measure computed with user-written function) based on this utility function and its derivatives according to the method introduced in Schneider (2017) <http://hdl.handle.net/21.11130/00-1735-0000-002E-E306-0>.
