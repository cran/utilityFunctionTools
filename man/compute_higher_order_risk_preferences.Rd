\title{Computes a continuous and smooth function according to the given utility points}
\usage{
compute_higher_order_risk_preferences(
  x,
  y,
  ids = NULL,
  mode = 1,
  penalty_orders = c(4),
  ndx = 20,
  deg = 6,
  measures = c("risk-arrow-pratt", "crainich-eeckhoudt", "denuit-eeckhoudt"),
  ...,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a matrix or dataframe containing the certainty equivalents (x-values of utility points) for a given participant in each use case.}

\item{y}{can be a vector or a matrix representing the corresponding utility values (y-values of utility points).}

\item{ids}{a list containing the IDs of the participants. If not given, a list with IDs from 1 to n_observations will be created.}

\item{mode}{an integer between 0, 1, 2 representing the three possible modes: multiple imputation, optimal classification or 'weak' classification. Default is optimal classification (1).}

\item{penalty_orders}{vector or constant that contains the derivates that will be smoothened. The values in this vector should not be larger than 4.}

\item{ndx}{number of intervals to partition the distance between the lowest and highest x-values of the utility points.}

\item{deg}{degree of the B-spline basis. Determines the degree of the function to be estimated. If deg = 2, the estimated utility function will consist of quadratic functions.}

\item{measures}{the utility based (intensity) measures to be computed.}

\item{...}{additional parameters for user-defined measures.}

\item{root_filename}{filename containing the location of where the output files are going to be saved.}

\item{verbose}{shows some information while the program is running.}
}
\value{
A smooth and continuous function.
