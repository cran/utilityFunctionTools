\title{Computes the derivative of a function}
\usage{
derivative(x, coeffs, degree = 1, ndx = 20, deg = 6)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the x values for which the derivative should be computed.}

\item{coeffs}{the coefficient.}

\item{degree}{the degree of the derivative.}

\item{ndx}{number of intervals to partition the distance between the lowest and highest x-values of the utility points.}

\item{deg}{degree of the B-spline basis. Determines the degree of the function to be estimated. If deg = 2, the estimated utility function will consist of quadratic functions.}
}
\value{
the derivative of the specified degree.
}
